# Dots-And-Boxes-Game
In this project I recreated the Dots and Boxes Game through JavaScript. I used my basic knowledge of creating functions and started by creating a board.
Then I took player inputs and saved and showed them on the board. From there I calculated whether the board was completed or not. This would then lead to
an end-game message which would indicate the winner and ask if the player would like to play again. Firstly, I did this all in one class so that everything
was easy to access and it was easier. Then I used my basic object orientation knowledge to be able to create many classes that each held different functions. 
I added a Turn Result class which would calculate scores and switch players after every move. Like my other projects this project is to show my basic object 
orientation knowledge and functions knowledge of JavaScript. Hope you enjoy the game!
